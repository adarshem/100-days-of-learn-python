Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic word-guessing game where you try to guess the word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

## How to Play

1. The game will randomly choose a word.
2. You will be prompted to guess a letter.
3. If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).
4. If the guessed letter is not in the word, you will lose a life.
5. The game continues until you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.

## Game Rules

- You have 6 lives to guess the word.
- Each incorrect guess will cost you a life.
- The game ends when you lose all your lives.
