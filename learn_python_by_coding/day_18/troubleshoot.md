# Turtle Graphics Virtual Environment Issue Troubleshooting

This README explains the steps taken to resolve an issue where the **Turtle graphics UI window** opened in a small size with no turtle visible when running a Python script in a virtual environment.

## Problem
When running a Python script using the `turtle` module in a **virtual environment** (Python 3.9.6), the Turtle window would open in a very small size with no turtle visible. However, running the script without activating the virtual environment worked fine.

## Cause
The issue was caused by a mismatch between the Python version used in the **virtual environment (Python 3.9.6)** and the **system Python version (Python 3.13.1)**. The **`tkinter`** (which is used by the `turtle` module) was not functioning correctly in the virtual environment due to this version mismatch.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the virtual environment used the same Python version as the system (Python 3.13.1). Below are the steps taken to fix the issue.

## Steps to Fix the Issue

### 1. Deactivate the Virtual Environment
If the virtual environment was already activated, deactivate it:
```sh
deactivate
```
### 2. Remove the Existing Virtual Environment
```sh
rm -rf venv
```
### 3. Create a new virtual environment using the system Python version (Python 3.13.1):
```sh
python3 -m venv venv  # or python3.13 -m venv venv if python3 is not 3.13.1
```
### 4. Activate the new virtual environment:
```sh
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```
### 5. Install necessary libraries like tkinter and PythonTurtle:
```sh
pip install PythonTurtle tk
```
### 6. Run your python script
```sh
pip install PythonTurtle tk
```

### Outcome

After following these steps, the issue was resolved, and the Turtle graphics window opened correctly with the turtle visible. The problem was due to the virtual environment using an outdated Python version (3.9.6), and setting it to match the system version (3.13.1) fixed the issue.
