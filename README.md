## Day 1: Working with Variables

In this lesson, we created a simple Band Name Generator. The script prompts the user for the city they grew up in and the name of a pet, then combines these inputs to suggest a band name.

You can find the code for this lesson [here](learn_python_by_coding/day_1/working_with_variables.py).

Stay tuned for more updates as I progress through the 100 days of learning Python!
